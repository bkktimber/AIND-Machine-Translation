# English - French Translator with RNN

## 1. Synopsis

English - French Translator with RNN is the capstone project in my AIND.

My translator can archive 93% accuracy on word level from custom dataset that contains

- 227 unique words from 1,823,250 words in English
- 355 unique words from 1,961,295 words in French

Implementing the translator, I use word embeding and encoding-decoding layer to improve model preformance.

Following are libraries I use in this project:

- Tensorflow: Deep Learning library from Google
- Keras: A API for different libraries to build Deep Learning model
- Numpy: A library for mathematics operations   

## 2. Repository Structure

- `machine_trnaslation.html`: My machine translator in HTML
- `machine_trnaslation.ipynb`: My machine translator in Jupyter Notebook
- `helper.py`: File reader for `machine_trnaslation.ipynb`
- `project_tests.py`: Unit test file
